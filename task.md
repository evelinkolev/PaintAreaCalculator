# Instructions

You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters** of wall.
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

_number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
               = 1.6_

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be **rounded up to 2** cans.

## Example Input
```
3
9
```

## Example Output
```
You'll need 6 cans of paint.
```
